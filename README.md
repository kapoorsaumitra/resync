# resync
Batch file to sync system time 


When dual-booting between Windows and Linux, the system time (on Windows) tends to go out of sync after switching between the OSes. This can lead to issues with time-sensitive applications, scheduled tasks, and other time-dependent operations.

Just run `update_time.bat` when you log into windows to update the system time at a single click.
